**Description:**  
An AI-powered conversational appliance repair assistant focused on dishwashers and refrigerators.  
The system uses deterministic dialog routing with explicit state machines, and selectively applies an LLM only as a fallback parser for ambiguous natural language — preventing chatbot drift and ensuring reliable troubleshooting.

Supports guided diagnostics, part compatibility confirmation, installation guidance, and demo order / human handoff flows.
