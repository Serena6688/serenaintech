Hi, I'm **Serena Wu**, a graduate student at the **University of Pennsylvania**, where I'm pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer and Information Technology.

With a foundation in data analytics and a growing passion for software engineering, I thrive at the intersection of data, design, and code. I enjoy building things that are both **functional and human-centered**â€”from AI-driven games and backend systems to intuitive web apps and data-driven strategies.

Prior to grad school, I worked as a Data Analyst where I helped businesses optimize marketing and pricing strategies through insights and modeling. Iâ€™m now expanding my technical toolkit to become a well-rounded engineer capable of tackling end-to-end challenges.
