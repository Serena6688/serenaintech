# 💼 Projects

I design and build systems across **intelligent applications, full-stack platforms,
machine learning, and systems infrastructure**.

My projects emphasize **end-to-end ownership** — from problem formulation and system
architecture to implementation, evaluation, and iteration.

Use the navigation on the left to explore projects by category, or start below for a high-level overview.

## 🤖 Intelligent Systems

Projects that combine **LLM-assisted reasoning**, explicit control logic, and
stateful system design to solve real-world problems reliably.

- **PartSelect Parts Assistant**  
  An LLM-assisted conversational system for appliance diagnostics and part compatibility,  
  built with deterministic dialog routing and selective LLM fallback.  
  👉 [View project](/serenaintech/software-project/partselect-parts-assistant/)

- **Nexus: Full-Stack Esports Analytics Platform**  
  An end-to-end analytics platform integrating React, Node.js APIs, and SQL-based data pipelines  
  to analyze professional esports performance across games.
