  Used K-Means Clustering and Random Forest to segment users by behavior, demographics, and browsing history.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Implemented Linear Regression and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) models to predict conversion likelihood and customer lifetime value.

- **A/B Testing:**  
  Executed experiments, increasing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by **12.5%** over baseline recommendations.

- **Big Data Processing:**  
  Cleaned and modeled Alibaba e-commerce data across 29 categories and 4 core dimensions.
