# 🎯 Customer Targeting Strategy

**Client:** Nivea  

[//]: # (**Role:** Data Analyst  )

**Duration:** Feb 2022 – Feb 2023  
**Tools:** Python, SQL, MySQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Excel, Alibaba Cloud

## 📌 Project Overview

Developed data-driven targeting strategies by analyzing e-commerce user profile data to identify high-potential customer segments. Validated insights with a full-scale campaign rollout, leading to a **14.3% YoY increase in ad effectiveness**.

## 🧠 Techniques & Methodologies

- **Advanced Segmentation:**  
  Used K-Means Clustering and Random Forest to segment users by behavior, demographics, and browsing history.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Implemented Linear Regression and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) models to predict conversion likelihood and customer lifetime value.

- **A/B Testing:**  
  Executed experiments, increasing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by **12.5%** over baseline recommendations.

- **Big Data Processing:**  
  Cleaned and modeled Alibaba e-commerce data across 29 categories and 4 core dimensions.

## 📊 Key Findings & Results

- **Improved ROAS:**
    - Body Lotion (AHA) → ROAS ↑ 22%
    - Skincare Set → ROAS ↑ 14%

- **Segment Insights:**
    - Identified segments like "Trendy Urban Youth" and "Stylish Young Moms" with high brand alignment and opportunity match.
    - Used PCA, Pearson/Spearman correlations, and Silhouette Analysis to optimize clustering.

## 📈 Methodology Steps

1. Data Collection (from Alibaba platform)
2. Tag Selection & Segmentation using Random Forest & K-Means
3. Segment Evaluation via Pearson Correlation Coefficients
4. Consumer Profiling to refine targeting
