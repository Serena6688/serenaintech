# 🌱 Personal Life

Beyond data and code, I find joy in exploring cultures, discovering flavors, and embracing everyday beauty.

## 🌍 Travel & Culture

I’ve lived in **New York City for 6 years** and **Shanghai for 4 years**, two places that shaped how I see the world — fast-paced, diverse, and full of stories.  
Travel is my favorite way to reset and reimagine. Whether wandering side streets in Tokyo or hiking coastal trails in Portugal, I’m always chasing perspective.

## 🍜 Food & Flavor

I’m a lifelong foodie — from late-night noodle spots in Shanghai to hidden falafel counters in the East Village.  
Cooking is my weekend therapy, and I love recreating flavors I’ve encountered on the road.

## 🐇 Meet Pudding, My Bunny

Pudding is my fluffy roommate and emotional support animal.  
She’s curious, sassy, and has a strong preference for cilantro over carrots.

Whether she’s napping in a sunbeam or doing zoomies across the floor, she reminds me to slow down and enjoy the little moments.

> 🐾 Favorite hobbies: chewing cardboard, rearranging rugs, and ignoring toys bought with love.

## 🧘 Stillness & Play

Life in tech can be intense, so I prioritize balance through mindfulness, photography, and long walks.  
Whether it’s journaling by a window or discovering a local jazz bar, I believe personal inspiration fuels professional growth.
