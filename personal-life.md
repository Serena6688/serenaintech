# 🌱 Life Outside Code

Beyond data and code, I find joy in exploring cultures, discovering flavors, and embracing everyday beauty.

## 🌍 Travel & Culture

I’ve lived in New York City for 6 years and Shanghai for 4 years, two places that shaped how I see the world — fast-paced, diverse, and full of stories.  
Travel is my favorite way to reset and reimagine. Whether wandering historic markets in Istanbul, soaking in the skyline of Hong Kong, or enjoying the charm of Macau’s old town, I’m always chasing new perspectives.

## 🍜 Food & Flavor

I’m a lifelong foodie — from late-night noodle spots in Shanghai to hidden falafel counters in the East Village.  
Cooking is my weekend therapy, and I love recreating flavors I’ve encountered on the road.

## 🐇 Meet Pudding, My Bunny

Pudding is my fluffy roommate and emotional support animal.  
She’s curious, sassy, and has a strong preference for cilantro over carrots.

Whether she’s napping in a sunbeam or doing zoomies across the floor, she reminds me to slow down and enjoy the little moments.

> 🐾 Favorite hobbies: chewing cardboard, rearranging rugs, and ignoring toys bought with love.

## 🧘 Stillness & Play

Life in tech can be intense, so I prioritize balance through mindfulness, photography, and long walks.  
Whether it’s journaling by a window or discovering a local jazz bar, I believe personal inspiration fuels professional growth.
